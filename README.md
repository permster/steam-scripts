# steam-scripts

<b>Steam_installed.ps1</b> - A small PowerShell script that parses out the .acf files in your SteamApps folder.  Main use here is to backup a list of installed games so that you don't have to backup your entire Steam library.  Outputs the following to CSV.
- File (Path to ACF file)
- AppID
- Name (game name)

This is useful if your hard drive dies or you partition/format the drive your steam library is on.  You now have a list of the games that were installed previously so you know which Steam games to reinstall.
